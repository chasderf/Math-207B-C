\textbf {Chapter 1.1 Paritial Differential Equations} A partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation involving an unknown function of two or more variables and certain of its partial deriviatives. 

\textbf{Definition} An expression of the form \\
(1) \tab $F(D^k u(x), D^{k-1} u(x),..., Du(x), u(x), x) = 0$ \tab $(x \in U)$ \\
is called a kth-order partial differential equation, where
\begin{center}
$F: R^{n^k} x R^{n^{k-1}} x \dots R^n x R x U \to R$
\end{center}
is given and 
\begin{center}
$u : U \to R$
\end{center}
is the unknown.

\textbf {Definitions} \\
(i) The partial differential equation (1) is called linear if it has the form
\begin{center}
$\sum{|\alpha| \leq k} a_{\alpha}(x) D^{\alpha}u = f(x)$
\end{center}
for given functions $a_{\alpha}(|\alpha| \leq k), f$. This linear PDE is homogeneous if f = 0. \\
(ii) The PDE (1) is semilinear if it has the form
\begin{center}
$\sum_{|\alpha|=k} a_\alpha (x) D^{\alpha} u + a_0 (D^{k-1}u,...,Du,u,x) = 0$
\end{center}
(iii) The PDE (1) is fully nonlinear if it depends nonlinearly upon the highest order derivatives. 

\textbf {Definition} An expression of the form \\
(2) \tab $F(D^k u(x), D^{k-1}u(x),...,Du(x), u(x), x) = 0 \tab (x \in U)$
is called a kth-order system of partial differential equations, where
\begin{center}
$F: R^{{mn}^k} x R^{{mn}^{k-1}} x \dots x R^{mn} x R^m x U \to R^m$
\end{center}
is given and 
\begin{center}
$u : U \to R^m, u = (u^1 ,..., u^m)$
\end{center}
is the unknown
